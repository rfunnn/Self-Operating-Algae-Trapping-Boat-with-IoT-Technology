# Self-Operating-Algae-Trapping-Boat-with-IoT-Technology

## Abstart
Algae are defined as a group of aquatics, photosynthetic organisms that lack roots, stems, leaves, and the reproductive structure of plants. They can be found worldwide and are most common in high nutrient water. Due to its commonly found nature, researchers tried to find applications for these organisms. Today, we have found several 
uses for them ranging from food supplements, fertilizers, and alternatives for oil-based plastic as well as fossil fuels (Biofuel). Several methods have been introduced 
to cultivate algae for this use including an algae farm. The problem with this is that algae applications require a large amount of alga for it to be a viable 
alternative thus requiring many farms. This project aims to be an autonomous solution to algae collecting and harvesting

## Objectives
1. To develop a self-operating boat to trap algae by using ESP-32 microcontroller with IoT Technology.
2. To ease the process of cleaning up algae by eliminating the need to use manpower.
